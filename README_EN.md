# **Rabithua / Yu Changye**

Location: Liangzhu, Hangzhou

Email: [rabit.hua@gmail.com][1]

Current Status: Burned out and left Bonjour, currently in a GAP year while searching for a lifelong passion career (or finding a job to sustain myself before my savings run out). Don't want to be limited to programming development, exploring UI and interaction design, how to become a photographer or chef, while also learning how to organize my life properly.

## Find Me

> Can do - Don't want to admit I'm skilled at mini-program development, but I've indeed built many mini-programs. Also learned Vue for business needs, though I'm ashamed I'm not a Vue master. If you ask me to do uni-app or debug legacy projects, there's a high chance I'll refuse, unless you pay very well (or I'm too broke to afford food)

> Learning - Don't mind the stuff below, procrastinating as usual
